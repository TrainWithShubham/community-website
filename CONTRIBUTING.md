### Contributing Guide

Welcome! This repo is designed to help developers and DevOps engineers learn by shipping real features with high-quality practices.

#### Workflow
1) Find/claim an issue or open a proposal
2) Create a feature branch from `main`
3) Make focused changes; add tests/screenshots where relevant
4) Commit with Conventional Commits via `npm run commit`
5) Open a PR with a semantic title; fill the auto template; request review

#### Conventional Commits
- Format: `type(scope): short imperative summary`
- Types: `feat, fix, docs, chore, build, ci, test, refactor, perf, style`
- Scopes: `events, calendar-api, projects, interview-questions, ui, seo, assets, build, genkit, perf, docs, ci, infra, analytics, sheets-api, cache, repo`
- Subject â‰¤ 72 chars; body explains why/how; reference issues (e.g., Closes #123)

Examples
```text
feat(projects): add filters and README viewer
fix(interview-questions): stabilize pagination auto-refresh
build(genkit): defer prompt/flow creation to runtime
```

#### Local Commands
- `npm i` â†’ install
- `npm run dev` â†’ start dev server
- `npm run commit` â†’ guided commit (Commitizen)
- `npm run lint:commits` â†’ validate commit messages
- `npm run build` â†’ production build

#### PR Checklist
- One logical change per PR; small, focused changes merge faster
- Semantic title and filled template (Why/What/How)
- Screenshots or recordings for UI changes
- Docs updated if behavior changes
- All checks green (semantic-pr, commitlint)

#### Code Style
- TypeScript strictness; meaningful names; shallow nesting; early returns
- Handle errors intentionally; avoid silent catches
- Accessibility: keyboard focus, ARIA where relevant

#### Governance & Reviews
- Code Owners auto-requested for relevant paths
- Branch protection requires CI checks and code owner review
- Be kind and constructive in reviews; ask for clarification as needed

#### Environments & Secrets
- Server: `GOOGLE_SHEETS_*`, `GOOGLE_SA_*`, `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `REVALIDATE_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
- Client: `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
- Configure variables on Vercel Project (Production/Preview) and locally `.env.local`

#### Where to Start
- Good first issues: docs, tests, accessibility, small UI polish
- Feature ideas: events pagination/resilience, projects discoverability, performance budgets

Happy shipping! ðŸš€
